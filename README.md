In the area of dynamical systems, a double pendulum also known as a chaos pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, forming a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions

In this project, we are going to find the equations of motions of the planar double pendulum, solve it in block diagrams, and simulate using Simscape Multibody in SIMULINK.
